A DESIGN.md document that includes documentation of your design (using CRC cards, UML class diagrams, and/or UML sequence diagrams as you find necessary; remember that a picture is worth a thousand words!). In particular, for any change that you had to make to the existing codebase, provide a rationale for why the change was made, and what alternatives were considered.

Acceptance Criteria:

- DESIGN.md file contains a description of any substantive changes to the existing Covey.Town codebase, and the architecture of your new code.
- It uses CRC cards, or state diagrams or any of the other techniques that help describe the structure.

## Document Starts here

Question - Do Front End Components (Pages like Login, Profile, etc) have CRC cards/Class Diagrams or Sequence Diagrams with a rationale/walkthrough will be enough?
